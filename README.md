# CGI Flood Prediction and Mitigation

Project repository for Fall 2022 NJBDA project with CGI.

Our goal is to build a working prototype that, at the minimum, helps CGI to better understand flood patterns in NJ.

We will be working in Python, Jupyter, Fast AI, and ArcGIS with related environmental data.
